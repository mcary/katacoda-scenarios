The script in the terminal on the right is installing AWX.  This
usually takes 2-3 minutes.

If interested, you can watch the commands as they run in the terminal
(bottom-right) or review them in /root/install-awx.sh (see the editor,
top-right).

Watch for the URL, user, and password to be emitted in the terminal as the
install script finishes.
