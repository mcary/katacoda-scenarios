This sandbox provides an environment for you to learn and explore Ruby on
Rails.

Rails is a full-stack "batteries-included" framework; it includes all the
tools needed to build web apps, both on the frontend and backend.  It
strives to enable developers to write expressive, concise code by following
conventions rather than requiring explicit configuration to wire together
an application's parts.  It enables production-grade security measures by
default, and scales from "Hello World" to IPO.

Rails is a general-purpose web frame work, so it works well for a building
a wide variety of types of web applications.  It's a particularly good fit
for situations where one or more of these apply:

* Your team consists mostly of "full-stack" developers, who can work on
  both the "frontend", with HTML templates and CSS, and on the "backend",
  with server code that responds to HTTP requests and updates the database.

* You want to get a minimum viable product (MVP) running quicky, using
  scaffolds and code generators, and refine it later, for example by moving
  long-running tasks to background jobs or by adding live updates to pages
  from collaborating users

* You want an app that feels really fast when your users are well-connected to
  the Internet, allowing you to develop your application page by page, but
  allowing a user's browser to skip re-parsing all the CSS and Javascript
  on every page, resulting in new pages fully loading in under 400ms (which is
  quite fast).

* Your application is mostly loading and storing records from and to a
  relational database (RDBMS) such as PostgreSQL or MySQL.

Rails has become quite flexible and can also serve well if:

* You mainly need to build an API to back a separate frontend code base
* You want a React or other Javascript frontend for your app

#### What are sandboxes?

Sandboxes give you a configured environment to start playing and exploring
using an unstructured learning approach. They're great for experimenting
and trying samples.
