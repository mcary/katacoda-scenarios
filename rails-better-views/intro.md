This lab explores ways to improve the visual quality of the views generated
by Ruby on Rails.

Rails can generate a scaffold to get your application off an running
quickly, creating files to hold all the details necessary to get a model,
controller, views, routes, tests, and more, all working together.  However,
the templates it generates are not intended for production use; they are
just a starting point.

This lab will expand upon those templates in various ways:

* Customize the scaffolded view with Bootstrap
* Push our customizations into scaffold templates so that additional
  scaffolds will benefit
* Extract something truly reusable -- a template or even a view component

## Prerequisites

This lab assumes basic familiarity with model, view, and controller layers
of Ruby on Rails.  If these topics are new to you, check out these
interactive labs first:
